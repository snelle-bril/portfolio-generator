`Project time 2 hours`

## Workflow
The sourcefiles for the generator consist of markdown files, such as this file, and images. The images and project titles can be defined in the manifest file. These are used for the navigation menu.

## Integration
The project makes use of the power of **Python** and **Markdown**. When run, the sourcefiles and templates are interpeted, and a simple website is generated.

### Thanks
I would like to thank everyone that uses this project as inspiration, or as a tool to generate.
